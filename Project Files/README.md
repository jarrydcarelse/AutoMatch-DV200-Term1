* About the Project
   * * Project Description
    -In this project, we were tasked to create a  Dashboard web application using React and Charts.js. The application will display real-time data. The application will utilize an asynchronous connection method to pull data from an external API, in connection with the Promise API. Students will create efficient and reusable UI elements using component-based development practices and implement React-specific application architecture and site navigation using the React Router module. The project will adhere to standard industry practices relating to project administration and maintenance, including version control using Git, clean code practices, and testing and debugging. The final deliverable will be a functional and visually appealing web application that presents the data in a thematic and data-driven way.

   * * Built With
    - React - A frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

    - Charts.js - A JavaScript library for creating data visualizations.

    - Node.js - A JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to use JavaScript on the server-side.

    - Git - A version control system for tracking changes in code.

    - Axios - A JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests to external APIs.

    - React Router - A routing library for React applications.

    - HTML/CSS - Markup and styling languages used to structure and style web pages.

* Getting Started
    * * Prerequisites
    - HTML/CSS - Markup and styling languages used to structure and style web pages.

    - JavaScript - A programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web pages.

    - Asynchronous programming - The ability to execute code asynchronously using callbacks, Promises, or async/await.

    - HTTP requests - The ability to make HTTP requests to external APIs using JavaScript.

    - React - A frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

    - Git - A version control system for tracking changes in code.


* Features and Functionality
    - The website should be able to get data from an external API that will provide the dashboard with data
    - There should be working graphs

* Concept Process
    * * Ideation
    - Decide on a type of API we are going to be using, what data will the API give.
    - Then we had to choose how we were3 going to layout out dashboard, we did this by making low fidelity wireframes so we could get 
    a better idea of how out website was going to look
    - choose a design style 

* Development Process
    * * Implementation Process
        * * * Highlights
        - Learning more about how to use API and how to implement it into different ways
        - Learnt how to use react and how to start a react application which was really interesting to me 
        * * * Challenges
        - Implementing real-time data updates using the API in our graphs 
        - Implementing a responsive design that actually works correctly 

* Conclusion 
    - I leant a lot this term and saw many different ways if doing certain things. I struggled a lot with this project as it was a lot tougher than the projects from year 1. Hopefully I can do a better job with next terms project
